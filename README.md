# OpenDrone
The Open Drone project aims to create a generic quadcopter 3d-printed frame fully equipped with FPV and an autonomous navigation. Traditional quadcopter frames often offer little or no space for all different electronic components required for a full equipped drone. The Open Drone project offers an alternative for those of us that like tinkering and build our own projects from scratch. The Open Drone frame has gone through various iterations and offers the following capabilities:

- One switch control to turn on all electronics
- A charging bay to easily charge drone without un-mounting the battery
- A servo controlled system that can be used to deliver cargo
- Space for GPS receiver on top of the drone for best reception
- Space for FPV Camera and Gimbal motors and controller
- Space for Pixhawk flight controller right in the middle of the drone
- Space for electric distribution, separated from main electronics
- Space for remote control transmitter, telemetry transmitter, and video transmitter (FPV)
- Space for large battery at the bottom of the drone for easy access

Recent updates (3/6/2016) v 2.3

- Reduced overall material from 337cm3 to 229cm3 (or about 134g of PLA)
- Removed front mounted camera gimbal due issue with vibrations cased by propellers
- Created new flight controller and GPS mount. This allows to skin the GPS out of it's shell to reduce some weight (I'm leaving the previous one 2,2 available in case you want to use it)
